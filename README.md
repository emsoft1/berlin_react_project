# React Berlin - Community Project

This is the git repository for the community project meeting. At this meeting,
we intend to develop a small project to help beginners learn React & improve
seniors’ mentorship skills.

## Roles
The project should:
- have a goal & be usable after every step 
- be community based (open source) & owned
- comprise clean, *don’t repeat yourself* (DRY) code programmed with *best
  practices* in mind
- be something fun
- Test driven development? Peer code review?
